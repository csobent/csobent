- 👋 Hi, I’m @csobent or Carter
- 👀 I’m interested in video gaming (specifically RPGs), reading (mystery, fantasy, dystopian, and more!), listening to podcasts, music (EDM, rap, pop, rock). I'm also a strong advocate for mental health and, especially, LGBTQ+ rights, since I am FTM! Ask me more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics and programs related to the field. If you have any tips and tricks, let me know!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on:
  - 1) Recognizing and improving on discrepancies in healthcare
  - 2) Creating more diverse and inclusive spaces in the workforce to ensure equality and equity for all
  - 3) Learning more about machine learning (specifically neural engineering relations)
  - 4) Analyzing data patterns in engineering, especially those involved in civil, environmental, and geotechnical engineering specialties
- 📫 How to reach me
